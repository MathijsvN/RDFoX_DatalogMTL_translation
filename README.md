# RDFox Advanced Reasoning Workshop

Welcome to the RDFox Advanced Reasoning Workshop!

## How to use the workshop material

1. Open the **Advanced Reasoning Workshop** folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - this should be your `<working_directory>`.

2. Start RDFox using the `start.rdfox` script. Directions can be found in `0-0_StartRDFox.ipynb` in the `notebooks` folder.

3. Open an exercise notebook and follow the instructions within.

4. !IMPORTANT: Run every cell in order within a given notebook (they heavily depend on one another).

## Useful tips

1. Split your editor between an exercise notebook and the relevant rules file.
