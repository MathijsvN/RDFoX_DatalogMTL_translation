# RDFox Advanced Reasoning Workshop

Welcome to the RDFox Advanced Reasoning Workshop!

In this workshop you will learn how to:
- write, debug and optimise advanced rules using all of RDFox's features for faster reasoning performance,
- manipulate sets of rule to take advantage of the most advanced functionality of reasoning,
- tips and tricks to improve your ability and understanding of reasoning with RDFox.

Contained within each notebook is:
- a simple example of a complex concept with details explanations of each part,
- a challenging rule-writing exercise,
- real world applications that are enabled by the kind of reasoning described.

## How to use the workshop material

1. Open the **Advanced Reasoning Workshop** folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - this should be your `<working_directory>`.

2. Start RDFox using the `start.rdfox` script. Directions can be found in `0-1_StartRDFox.ipynb` in the `notebooks` folder.

3. Open an exercise notebook and follow the instructions within.

4. IMPORTANT: Run every cell in order within a given notebook (they heavily depend on one another).

5. If when you run a cell it does not stop, refer to `0-2_Help.ipynb`.

## Useful tips to using this workshop

1. [Download the latest version of RDFox here](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/download) and [request a free trial here.](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/free-trial)

2. Get the [RDFox VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rdfox.rdfox-rdf) for syntax highlighting and in-IDE features.

3. When completing an exercise, split your editors viewport between the notebook and the relevant rule file.
