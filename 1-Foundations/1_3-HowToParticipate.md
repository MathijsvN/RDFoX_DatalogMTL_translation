# 1.3 How to Participate

<br>

## üî• &nbsp; Why is participation useful?

There are several core components to each chapter that will help you participate.

Active participation helps to improve understanding and the long-term retention of information so we highly encourage it!

<br>
<br>

## üìñ &nbsp; What is participation?

We also share more detailed definitions that will help you write the rules itself.

<br>
<br>

## ‚ö° &nbsp; Real world applications

Then we share real world examples of where this could be relevant.

<br>
<br>

## üî¨ &nbsp; Example

The first challenge comes with the example - this shows the simplest version of the rule stripped down to its core components.

As an active example, there is a script for you to run to see the impact of the rule.

## ‚úÖ &nbsp; Check the results

Whenever you see a green check mark, there is a script ready to run!

Copy the `script.rdfox` into the terminal to see this in action.

The scripts in the chapters import the relevant data and rules to show their impact.

<br>

## üöÄ &nbsp; Exercise

Finally comes an exercise - here you will have to write some Datalog of your own, using what you have learned so far.

Each chapter contains a file called incompleteRules.dlog like `1-Foundations/incompleteRules.dlog`.

These files contain spaces `___` for you to fill in (you don't need to do this for the foundations).

Once you've done that, there will always be a script below to validate your work.

<br>
<br>

## ‚úÖ &nbsp; Check your answers

Run the script below to verify the results.

`script.rdfox`

<br>

### You should see...

```
============================
Congratulations, you did it!
============================
```

<br>
<br>

## üëè &nbsp; Bonus exercise

If you finish this before the time is up, there is also a bonus question to consider!

This is often much harder and requires your to create your own rule from scratch.

We won't go through the answer so you'll have to validate it yourself by writing a query [in the console](http://localhost:12110/console/datastores/sparql?datastore=default).

We highly encourage you to attempt these in your own time after the workshop even if you don't complete them on the day.

The best place to discuss your solutions is in the `RDFox-Workshop` channel of our [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/rdfox/shared_invite/zt-1z7dnm2ad-WoKRf~~3CynB_KTi5X0RHg).
