# 1.3 How to Participate

<br>

## üî• &nbsp; Interactive examples and exercises

Throughout the workshop there are several examples and exercises, each with an accompanying script to make your life easier!

In some cases, you will have to write your own Datalog before running the script to get the desired result.

<br>
<br>

## üîç &nbsp; Note Taking

These files are markdown `.md` files and can be edited by double clicking anywhere on the page.

Feel free to take nodes in-line!

You can return to the normal view by clicking on the file in the explorer window to the left again, or by clicking `preview` in the top right hand corner.

<br>

## üî¨ &nbsp; Example

The first challenge comes with the example - this shows the simplest version of the rule stripped down to its core components.

<br>
<br>

## ‚úÖ &nbsp; Check the results

Whenever you see a green check mark, there is a script ready to run!

Copy `1-Foundations/script.rdfox` into the terminal to see this in action.

The scripts in the chapters import the relevant data and rules to show their impact.

<br>
<br>

## üöÄ &nbsp; Exercise

Each chapter contains a file called incompleteRules.dlog like `1-Foundations/incompleteRules.dlog`.

These files contain spaces `___` for you to fill in (you don't need to do this for the foundations).

Once you've done that, there will always be a script below to validate your work.

<br>
<br>

## ‚úÖ &nbsp; Check your answers

Run the script below to verify the results.

`1-Foundations/script.rdfox`

<br>

### You should see...

```

Congratulations, you did it!

## üëè &nbsp; Bonus exercise

If you finish this before the time is up, there is also a bonus question to consider!

This is often much harder and requires your to create your own rule from scratch.

We won't go through the answer so you'll have to validate it yourself by writing a query [in the console](http://localhost:12110/console/datastores/sparql?datastore=default).

We highly encourage you to attempt these in your own time after the workshop even if you don't complete them on the day.

The best place to discuss your solutions is in the `RDFox-Workshop` channel of our [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/rdfox/shared_invite/zt-1z7dnm2ad-WoKRf~~3CynB_KTi5X0RHg).
