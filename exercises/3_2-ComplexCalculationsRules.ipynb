    "Reasoning can be used to perform complex calculations and analysis as `BIND` offers the flexibility to describing mathematical expressions using variables and in-build functions.\n",

    "Complex calculations often require complex patterns, so layering rules can helpful - referring to patterns in one rule that were created by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very common in practice, not just in calculations, to construct intricate patterns over several rules - breaking the problem down into bit sized chunks.\n",
    "\n",
