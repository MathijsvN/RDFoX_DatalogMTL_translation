    "# 3.2 Complex Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning can be used to perform complex calculations and analysis as `BIND` offers the flexibility to describing mathematical expressions using variables and in-build functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex calculations often require complex patterns, so layering rules can helpful - referring to patterns in one rule that were created by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very common in practice, not just in calculations, to construct intricate patterns over several rules - breaking the problem down into bit sized chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also greatly benefit the efficiency of reasoning - some common examples are explored throughout the workshop."

    "\n",
    "Our Term Frequency analysis assigns common terms a lower weighting than rare terms that receive a much higher weighting.\n",
