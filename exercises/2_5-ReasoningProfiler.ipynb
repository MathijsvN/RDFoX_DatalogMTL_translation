    "# 2.5 Debugging Rules with the Reasoning Profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary tool in debugging slow rules is the Reasoning Profiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "It prints information about the progress of the reasoning algorithms to the RDFox shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reasoning Profiler provides clues as to what is going on - the information it provides must be interpreted in the context of your rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "It  does not provide one-size-fits-all solutions, instead providing an excellent place to start when debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the Profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, you must first to enable it by running `set reason.monitor profile` in the RDFox shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the reasoning is complete, either from importing rules or data, a table detailing the computation involved will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Printing more details\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule plans can be printed alongside the profiler information with `set reason.profiler.log-plans true`, providing a greater level of detail for when it's needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the log-frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the information is printed after the reasoning has completed however, this can be unhelpful as it is possible to write rules that are very long running or even infinite, in which case it is much more helpful to know the progress of the reasoner.\n",
    "\n",
    "A log of the profiles can be printed at set intervals with `set log-frequency 10` - setting the print frequency to every 10 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is helpful in the majority of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All of these have been added to the `start.rdfox` script.**\n",
