# 3.2 Complex Calculations

<br>

## üî• &nbsp; Why are Complex Calculations helpful?

Need to perform calculations or any complexity in your application?

RDFox has you covered!

For example, my application requires complex mathematical algorithms to compute specific metrics, such as recommendations.

<br>
<br>

## üìñ &nbsp; What Complex Calculations?

Binds calculate an expression and store result in a variable.

This can be done with inbuilt RDFox functions or hand written mathematical expressions.

In practice it's very common to construct complex results using several rules - breaking the problem down into bite sized chunks.

This can also greatly benefit the efficiency of reasoning - some common examples are explored throughout the workshop.

<br>
<br>

## ‚ö° &nbsp; Real world applications

Calculations are relevant in almost every use case, whenever data needs to be transformed or analysed.

<br>

### Finance

To recognize fraud in real-time based on complex triggers, to apply regulation restrictions to transactions, etc.

<br>

### Data Analysis

To compute complex mathematical functions over large and changing data, to surface valuable insights, etc.

<br>

### Manufacturing

To calculate complex product compatibility, to model configuration viability, to simulate failure modes and maintenance, etc.

<br>
<br>

## üî¨ &nbsp; Example

![Complex Calculations](../images/complexCalculations.png)

The following rules perform Term Frequency Analysis for articles tagged by their content types, in order to recommend similar articles.

```
[?tag, :hasFrequency, ?termFrequency] :-
    AGGREGATE (
        [?article, :hasTag, ?tag]
        ON ?tag
        BIND COUNT(?article) AS ?totalTagMentions
    ),
    BIND (LOG(1/?totalTagMentions) AS ?termFrequency) .
```
```
[?recommendationNode, :hasRecommendedArticle, ?article1],
[?recommendationNode, :hasRecommendedArticle, ?article2],
[?recommendationNode, :pairHasSimilarityScore, ?similarityScore] :-
    AGGREGATE(
        [?article1, :hasTag, ?tag],
        [?article2, :hasTag, ?tag],
        [?tag, :hasFrequency, ?termFrequency]
        ON ?article1 ?article2
        BIND SUM( -1 / ?termFrequency ) AS ?similarityScore
    ),
    SKOLEM(?article1, ?article2, ?recommendationNode),
    FILTER(?article1 > ?article2) .
```

Here is the data we'll be using to show this:

```
:article1 :hasTag :AI ,
                :semanticReasoning .

:article2 :hasTag :semanticReasoning .

:article3 :hasTag :AI .

:article4 :hasTag :AI .
```

<br>
<br>

## ‚úÖ &nbsp; Check the results

Run `3_2-ComplexCalculations/example/exScript.rdfox` to see the results of this rule.

<br>

### You should see...

=== Similar Articles ===
|?article1	|?article2|	?similarityScore|
|---|---|---|
|:article1|	:article2|	1.4426950408889634e+0|
|:article1|	:article4|	9.1023922662683732e-1|

### Visualise the results

Open this query in the [RDFox Explorer](http://localhost:12110/console/datastores/explore?datastore=default&query=SELECT%20%3FrecommendationNode%20%3Farticle1%20%3Farticle2%20%3FsimilarityScore%20%3Ftag%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%3FrecommendationNode%20%3AhasRecommendedArticle%20%3Farticle1%20%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%3AhasRecommendedArticle%20%3Farticle2%20%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%3ApairHasSimilarityScore%20%3FsimilarityScore%20.%0A%20%20%20%20%3Farticle1%20%3AhasTag%20%3Ftag%0A%20%20%20%20FILTER%28%3Farticle1%20%3C%20%3Farticle2%29%0A%7D%20ORDER%20BY%20ASC%28%3Farticle1%29%20DESC%28%3FsimilarityScore%29).

<br>
<br>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è &nbsp; Syntax helper

These Term Frequency Analysis rules assign common terms a lower weighting than rarer terms.

A node is created between two articles that share at least one tag, calculating a similarity score based on shared weighted tags.

<br>
<br>

## üëÄ &nbsp; info rulestats

Run the command `info rulestats` in the RDFox shell to show information about the rules in your data store.

So far, for this example you will see:

=================== RULES STATISTICS =====================
|Component|    Nonrecursive rules|    Recursive rules|    Total rules|
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
|        1|                     1|                  0|              1|
|        2|                     1|                  0|              1|
|Total:|                        2|                  0|              2|

We have imported two rules above, so the total rules is 2.

Both are non-recursive (see 3.3 for recursion) which is also reflected in the table.

Since one rule depends on the other, we end up with 2 components (also called layers, or strata)

This can be a great launching point for debugging rules, particularly if the values shown are not what you expect.

Find out more about the `info` command in the docs [here](https://docs.oxfordsemantic.tech/rdfox-shell.html#info).

## üîç &nbsp; Unnecessarily complex rules

It can be tempting to write huge rules that match sprawling patterns and infer many heads at once, but this can be deeply inefficient.

Rules should be streamlined, only considering the minimum number of body atoms required to infer the relevant head facts, otherwise computation will be spent matching irrelevant body patterns for some head atoms.

This often means splitting large rules into several parts.

Take these rules for examples:

```
[?a, :hasNewProp, "new prop"],
[?x, a, :newClass] :-
    [?a, :hasProp, "prop" ],
    [?x, a, :Class ].
```

Although we can write this as one rule, there is no relation between the atoms involving ?a and ?x.

```
[?a, :hasNewProp, "new prop"]:-
    [?a, :hasProp, "prop" ].

[?x, a, :newClass] :-
    [?x, a, :Class ].
```
Here, we're split that rule into two rules that results in the same facts inferred.

We'll use this simple data to show how the rule sets perform differently:
```
:a :hasProp "prop" .

:x a :Class .
```

<br>

## üëÄ &nbsp; Run the profiler

Firstly, run `3_2-ComplexCalculations/example2/exScript.rdfox` to see the performance of the combined rule...

<br>

### You should see...

Rule Info
|   #  |    Reasoning Phase   |   Sample Count  |  Rule Body Match Attempts |   Iterator Operations  |  Rule Body Matches  |    Fresh Facts Produced    |Rule of Head Atom|                               
|------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
|   1|    RuleAdd|      0|             1|             6|           1|            1|          (0) :hasNewProp[?a, "new prop"], :newClass[?x] :- :hasProp[?a, "prop"], :Class[?x] .|
|   |    |      |             |             |           |            1|          (1) :hasNewProp[?a, "new prop"], :newClass[?x] :- :hasProp[?a, "prop"], :Class[?x] .|

Notice that the reasoning profiles undergoes 6 iterator operations. This is because the combo rule creates a cross product of patterns that it must check to infer each head atom, despite being unrelated.

<br>
<br>

## üëÄ &nbsp; Run the profiler

Secondly, run `3_2-ComplexCalculations/example3/exScript.rdfox` to see the performance of the two separate rules.

<br>

### You should see...

Rule Info
|   #  |    Reasoning Phase   |   Sample Count  |  Rule Body Match Attempts |   Iterator Operations  |  Rule Body Matches  |    Fresh Facts Produced    |Rule of Head Atom|                               
|------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
|   1|    RuleAdd|      0|             1|             2|           1|            1|          (0) :newClass[?x] :- :Class[?x] .|
|   1|    RuleAdd|      0|             1|             2|           1|            1|          (0) :hasNewProp[?a, "new prop"] :- :hasProp[?a, "prop"] .|

This time, notice that even though there are more rules imported, the rules only require 2 iterator operations each, for a total of 4.

### A problem of scale

While 6 iterations instead of 4 is almost invisible, this problem scales dangerously with the number of triples and complexity of the rule, causing drastic slowdowns.

## üöÄ &nbsp; Exercise

Complete the rule `3_2-ComplexCalculations/incompleteRules.dlog` to calculate the percentage of articles that each tag appears in, rounded to the nearest percentage point:

Here is a representative sample of the data in `3_2-ComplexCalculations/exercise/data.ttl`.

```
:blog :containsArticle :article001 ,
                        :article002 .

:article001 a :Article ;
    :hasTag :AI ,
        :SemanticReasoning ,
        :Technology .
```
